# Hi, I'm Janak Vasisht!

Aspiring Engineer | AI & Physics Enthusiast | Research-Driven Problem Solver

I'm a high school student with a strong interest in **engineering**, **artificial intelligence**, **physics**, and **electrical systems**. I enjoy combining programming with scientific research to explore real-world challenges. Currently, I'm working on:

- 🌬️ **Wind Turbine Research** — optimizing blade design and performance using AI techniques like GANs and genetic algorithms.  
- ⚡ **Load Forecasting** — applying machine learning to predict and manage energy demand more efficiently.

Some of this work is being done in collaboration with researchers at **George Mason University**, where I'm gaining hands-on research experience in applying AI to energy systems.

I'm always looking to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects at the intersection of technology and sustainability.
